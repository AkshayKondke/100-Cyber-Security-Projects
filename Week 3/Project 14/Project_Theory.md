# Project Theory: Wi-Fi Network Scanning 🚀

## Overview 🌐
Wi-Fi network scanning involves detecting and retrieving details about wireless networks in the vicinity of your device. This includes identifying SSIDs (network names), BSSIDs (MAC addresses), signal strengths, and security configurations.

## Key Concepts to Learn 📚

### 1. **Wi-Fi Basics** 📡
   - **What is Wi-Fi?**: Wireless Fidelity is a technology that allows devices to connect to the internet without physical cables.
   - **SSID (Service Set Identifier)**: The name of a Wi-Fi network.
   - **BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier)**: The MAC address of the access point broadcasting the Wi-Fi signal.
   - **Signal Strength**: Measured in dBm, this indicates the quality of the Wi-Fi signal.

### 2. **Networking Fundamentals** 🛠️
   - **802.11 Standards**: Understand the Wi-Fi protocols (e.g., 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax).
   - **Frequency Bands**: Learn about 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies and their pros/cons.
   - **Encryption Methods**: Explore Wi-Fi security types like WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3.

### 3. **Python Libraries for Networking** 🐍
   - **pywifi**: A Python library to manage and manipulate wireless networks.
     - Functions for scanning, connecting, and managing networks.
   - **time**: Used for adding delays in network scanning.

### 4. **Operating System Interaction** 🖥️
   - **Wi-Fi Interfaces**: Learn how operating systems manage wireless interfaces.
   - **Permissions**: Understand the need for admin/root privileges for certain actions.

### 5. **Error Handling in Python** ⚠️
   - Learn to handle exceptions and errors (e.g., missing modules, unsupported devices).
   - Common Python modules like `try` and `except` blocks.

### 6. **Networking Tools and Utilities** 🧰
   - Explore tools like `ifconfig` (Linux) or `ipconfig` (Windows) to understand Wi-Fi interfaces.
   - Familiarize yourself with built-in OS utilities to troubleshoot Wi-Fi issues.
