# 📝 To-Do List CLI App - Project Theory

## 1. 🚀 Introduction
A To-Do List CLI App is a simple command-line tool that helps users track their tasks effectively. This project involves implementing a text-based interface where users can add, remove, update, and mark tasks as completed.

## 2. 📚 Prerequisites
Before starting the project, you should have a fundamental understanding of the following concepts:

### **🐍 Python Basics**
- Variables and Data Types (strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
- Control Structures (if-else statements, loops)
- Functions and Modules
- Exception Handling (try-except blocks)

### **📂 File Handling**
- Reading and Writing files in Python (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`)
- Using JSON files to store task data (`json` module)

### **🛠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (Optional, but useful)**
- Classes and Objects
- Methods and Attributes
- Encapsulation and Inheritance

### **💻 Command-Line Arguments (CLI Interaction)**
- `argparse` module for handling user inputs
- Parsing command-line arguments to perform actions like adding or deleting tasks

## 3. 🎯 Core Features of the App
- ✅ **Add a new task**: Store tasks with descriptions and due dates (optional)
- 📜 **View tasks**: Display all tasks (pending and completed)
- ✏️ **Update a task**: Modify task details
- 🎯 **Mark a task as completed**: Update the task status
- 🗑 **Delete a task**: Remove a task from the list
- 💾 **Persistent storage**: Save tasks in a file (JSON or text file)

## 4. 🌟 Advanced Features (Optional)
- 🔥 Categorizing tasks by priority (High, Medium, Low)
- 🔍 Implementing search functionality
- ⏳ Adding due dates and reminders
- 📤 Exporting tasks to a CSV file
- 🗃 Using SQLite or another database for storage

## 5. 🛠 Technologies and Libraries Used
- **🐍 Python 3**: Core programming language
- **⚙️ argparse**: For command-line argument parsing
- **📄 json**: For data storage in a structured format
- **📂 os**: To handle file operations
- **⏰ datetime**: To manage due dates for tasks (optional)

## 6. 🏗 Project Structure
```
ToDo-CLI-App/
│── todo.py  # Main script
│── tasks.json  # Storage file for tasks
│── README.md  # Project documentation
|── Project_Theory  # Project Theory file 
```

## 7. 🏆 Steps to Build the Project
1. **🛠 Set up the environment**: Install Python and required libraries
2. **📝 Create a Python script**: Initialize the CLI app
3. **⚡ Implement task management functions** (add, view, update, delete, complete)
4. **💾 Handle file storage**: Store and retrieve tasks using JSON
5. **🎨 Enhance user experience**: Improve command-line interface and error handling
6. **🔍 Test the application**: Ensure all functions work correctly
7. **🌍 Upload to GitHub**: Maintain version control and documentation

## 8. 📌 GitHub Repository Guidelines
- 📜 Include a `README.md` with instructions on how to use the CLI app
- 🚫 Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- 🖊 Write clean and well-commented code
- 📂 Follow best practices for structuring the repository

---
By understanding these concepts, you will be well-prepared to build your To-Do List CLI App in Python. 🚀 Happy coding! 🎉
