# File Encryptor (AES) - Project Theory 📂🔒

## Introduction to Cryptography 🌐🔑
Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into a format that unauthorized parties cannot read. For this project, we focus on **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**, a widely used encryption algorithm.

### Key Concepts of Cryptography 🧠
1. **Encryption**: Transforming plaintext into ciphertext (unreadable format).
2. **Decryption**: Converting ciphertext back into plaintext.
3. **Symmetric Encryption**: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

## Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 🔐
### What is AES?
AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm adopted as a standard by the U.S. government. It is highly secure and efficient.

### Key Features 📝
- **Key Sizes**: AES supports 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit keys.
- **Block Size**: Operates on 16-byte blocks of data.
- **Modes of Operation**: Determines how blocks are encrypted:
  - **ECB (Electronic Codebook)**: Simplest but insecure for large data.
  - **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**: Secure for file encryption, requires an Initialization Vector (IV).
  - **GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)**: Adds data integrity checks.

## Python Libraries for AES 🚀🐍
- Use **PyCryptodome** for AES encryption in Python.
  - Install it using `pip install pycryptodome`.
- Key functions:
  - `AES.new()`: Create a new AES cipher.
  - `encrypt()`: Encrypt data.
  - `decrypt()`: Decrypt data.

---

## File Handling Basics 📁📜
- **Binary Mode**: Read (`rb`) and write (`wb`) files in binary mode.
- **Metadata**: Preserve file metadata to ensure usability after decryption.

---

## Padding and Block Size 🔢🧩
- AES works on 16-byte blocks. If data isn’t a multiple of 16 bytes, padding is needed.
  - Common padding: **PKCS7**.
- Padding ensures that encryption works seamlessly and can be removed during decryption.

## Key Management 🔑🗄️
1. **Key Generation**: Use secure methods to generate random keys.
2. **Key Storage**: Store keys securely (e.g., environment variables, secure files).
3. **No Hardcoding**: Avoid embedding keys directly in your code.

---

## Security Best Practices 🛡️✅
1. **Initialization Vector (IV)**:
   - Ensures unique encryption for identical data.
   - Never reuse IVs with the same key.
2. **Randomness**:
   - Use secure random number generators for keys and IVs.
3. **Avoid Common Mistakes**:
   - Reusing keys/IVs.
   - Storing sensitive data in plaintext.

---

## Error Handling and Validation 🚨⚠️
- Handle exceptions during encryption/decryption (e.g., corrupted files, incorrect keys).
- Validate file integrity after decryption.

---

## Structuring Your Project 🗂️✨
Design your project with modularity in mind. Suggested structure:

1. **Key Generation**: A function to generate and save keys securely.
2. **Encryption**: A function to encrypt files.
3. **Decryption**: A function to decrypt files.
4. **File Handling**: Read and write files in binary mode.
