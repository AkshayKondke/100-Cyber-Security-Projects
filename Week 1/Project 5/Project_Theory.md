# Port Scanning with Nmap 🔧

## Introduction 
Port scanning is a technique used to identify open ports and services available on a networked device. It plays a crucial role in network security and system administration by helping to:

- Identify vulnerabilities in a network ⚠️
- Detect unauthorized services ❌
- Understand network configurations ⚙️

This project involves building a Python-based tool to perform port scanning using the Nmap tool.
  
## Key Concepts 

### 1. Networking Basics 
- **IP Address**: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. 💻
- **Ports**: Logical endpoints in a network connection. Ports are used to distinguish between different services running on the same IP. 
  - Common Ports:
    - HTTP: 80 ☑️
    - HTTPS: 443 🔒
    - SSH: 22 🔐
- **Protocols**: Rules that govern data communication. Common protocols include TCP, UDP, and ICMP. 🛡️

### 2. Port Scanning 
- **Open Ports**: Ports that actively accept connections. 🔗
- **Closed Ports**: Ports that are not in use. ❌
- **Filtered Ports**: Ports that are protected by a firewall or filtering device. 🔒
- **Scanning Techniques**:
  - **TCP Connect Scan**: Attempts to establish a full connection. ⚛️
  - **SYN Scan**: Sends SYN packets to detect open ports without completing the handshake. 🔧
  - **UDP Scan**: Checks for open UDP ports. 🌐

### 3. Nmap Basics 
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a popular open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. It offers powerful port scanning capabilities. 

- **Key Features**:
  - Host discovery 🔎
  - Port scanning 🔢
  - Service and version detection ⚙️
  - OS detection 💻

- **Common Nmap Commands**:
  - `nmap <target>`: Basic scan 🔧
  - `nmap -sS <target>`: SYN scan 🔢
  - `nmap -p <port> <target>`: Scan specific port 🔎

### 4. Python and Libraries for Nmap 
- **Python Basics**: Understanding functions, loops, and modules. 📚
- **Nmap Libraries**:
  - `python-nmap`: A Python library that provides an interface to Nmap. 🧰

## Requirements 

### Tools and Libraries 
1. Python (Version 3.x) 📚
2. Nmap installed on the system 🔢
3. `python-nmap` library 🔧

### Prerequisites 
- Basic understanding of Python programming 🔖
- Familiarity with networking concepts 🔗

## Project Workflow 

1. **Setup and Installation** 
   - Install Python and required libraries. 📃
   - Install Nmap on your system. 🔢

2. **Developing the Python Script** 
   - Import necessary modules. 🧰
   - Set up target IP and ports. 🔐
   - Execute Nmap commands using `python-nmap`. ⚙️
   - Parse and display results. 🔄

3. **Testing and Debugging** 
   - Test the script on different IP addresses and networks. 🔧
   - Validate the results against Nmap command-line outputs. 🔎

4. **Improvement and Deployment** 
   - Add advanced features like service detection and OS fingerprinting. 💡
   - Create a user-friendly interface (CLI or GUI). 🔄

## Ethical Considerations 
- Obtain proper authorization before scanning any network or device. 🚫
- Use the tool responsibly and for educational or professional purposes only. ✅

## Conclusion 
This project will provide hands-on experience in network scanning, enhance your Python skills, and deepen your understanding of Nmap's capabilities. The resulting tool can be a valuable resource for ethical hacking and network security assessments. ⚡
