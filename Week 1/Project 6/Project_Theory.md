## Theoretical Background

### 1. Hashing Basics
- **Definition**: Hashing is the process of converting data into a fixed-size string of characters, which represents the data's contents.
- **Properties of Hash Functions**:
  - Deterministic
  - Fixed-length output
  - Irreversibility
  - Collision resistance

### 2. Cryptographic Hash Functions
- **MD5**:
  - Fast but susceptible to collisions.
  - Suitable for checksums but not for security-critical tasks.
- **SHA-256**:
  - Secure and widely used in modern cryptographic applications.
  - Provides a 256-bit hash value, ensuring stronger resistance against attacks.

### 3. Python Libraries
- **hashlib**: The core library for implementing MD5 and SHA-256 hashing in Python.
- **os** and **sys**: For handling files and command-line inputs.
